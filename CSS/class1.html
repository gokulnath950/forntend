        A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” 
        (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a
         paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, 
         particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.

        Software testing is the act of examining the artifacts and the behavior of the software under 
        test by verification and validation. Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of 
        the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation.
